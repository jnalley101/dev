###**What is DevOps?**

DevOps is a new movement/idea of creating a more efficient way of conducting business in IT. 
It is the idea that in order to make sure development and operations area efficient, you must put the two teams together so 
that they can hold each other accountable. Work is completed much more efficiently and faster by having the development and 
operations teams working together to solve problems. DevOps helps build a better work environment by emphasizing teamwork. 
Development and operations collaborate more closely under the structure of DevOps due to shared responsibilities and combined workflows. 

Companies who have restructured the culture of their IT department to adopt this idea of collaboration between development and
operations have experienced many benefits as a result. The biggest benefit would be the ability to complete work much faster while
also being more accurate. Troubleshooting issues that arise while working on an application/product is faster and more accurate when
you have everyone who has worked on creating it/deploying it working together. Having an IT team that is able to keep up with the always
changing technological updates is key to having a successful business.
